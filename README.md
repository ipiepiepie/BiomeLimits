Have you ever wondered about plants, growing only in their native Biomes?

This plugin allows you to limit Block placing/breaking, based on Biomes.
You can limit any Block in game, but first of all this plugin aimed to confine crops, trees and other plants.

### How to use it

You can combine this limitations with any other plugin, to boost your server economy, by adding Biome factor to production of resources.

For example, you can combine it with **[Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny)** and **[Brewery](https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery)**, then players will have to harvest beverage ingridients in different Biomes, it'll increase the need for trade between Towns.
