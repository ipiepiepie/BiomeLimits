### How to use it

You can combine this limitations with any other plugin, to boost your server economy, by adding Biome factor to production of resources.

For example, you can combine it with **[Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny)** and **[Brewery](https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery)**, then players will have to harvest beverage ingridients in different Biomes, it'll increase the need for trade between Towns.
